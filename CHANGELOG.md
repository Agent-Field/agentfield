## [0.1.21-rc.2] - 2025-12-10


### Fixed

- Fix: correct parent execution ID for sub-calls in app.call() (#62)

When a reasoner calls a skill via app.call(), the X-Parent-Execution-ID
  header was incorrectly set to the inherited parent instead of the current
  execution. This caused workflow graphs to show incorrect parent-child
  relationships.

  The fix overrides X-Parent-Execution-ID to use the current execution's ID
  after to_headers() is called, ensuring sub-calls are correctly attributed
  as children of the calling execution.

## [0.1.20-rc.3] - 2025-12-04


### Fixed

- Fix(sdk/typescript): add DID registration to enable VC generation (#60)

* fix(release): skip example requirements for prereleases

Restore the check to skip updating example requirements for prerelease
versions. Even though prereleases are now published to PyPI, pip install
excludes them by default per PEP 440. Users running `pip install -r
requirements.txt` would fail without the `--pre` flag.

Examples should always pin to stable versions so they work out of the box.

* fix(sdk/typescript): add DID registration to enable VC generation

The TypeScript SDK was not registering with the DID system, causing VC
generation to fail with "failed to resolve caller DID: DID not found".

This change adds DID registration to match the Python SDK's behavior:

- Add DIDIdentity types and registerAgent() to DidClient
- Create DidManager class to store identity package after registration
- Integrate DidManager into Agent.ts to auto-register on startup
- Update getDidInterface() to resolve DIDs from stored identity package

When didEnabled is true, the agent now:
1. Registers with /api/v1/nodes/register (existing)
2. Registers with /api/v1/did/register (new)
3. Stores identity package for DID resolution
4. Auto-populates callerDid/targetDid when generating VCs

## [0.1.20-rc.2] - 2025-12-04


### Added

- Feat(release): unify PyPI publishing for all releases (#58)

Publish all Python SDK releases (both prerelease and stable) to PyPI
instead of using TestPyPI for prereleases.

Per PEP 440, prerelease versions (e.g., 0.1.20rc1) are excluded by
default from `pip install` - users must explicitly use `--pre` flag.
This simplifies the release process and removes the need for the
TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN secret.

Changes:
- Merge TestPyPI and PyPI publish steps into single PyPI step
- Update release notes to show `pip install --pre` for staging
- Update install.sh staging output
- Re-enable example requirements updates for prereleases
- Update RELEASE.md documentation

### Fixed

- Fix(release): fix example requirements and prevent future staging bumps (#56)

* fix(examples): revert to stable agentfield version (0.1.19)

The staging release bumped example requirements to 0.1.20-rc.1, but
RC versions are published to TestPyPI, not PyPI. This caused Railway
deployments to fail because pip couldn't find the package.

Revert to the last stable version (0.1.19) which is available on PyPI.

* fix(release): skip example requirements bump for prerelease versions

Prerelease versions are published to TestPyPI, not PyPI. If we bump
example requirements.txt files to require a prerelease version,
Railway deployments will fail because pip looks at PyPI by default.

Now bump_version.py only updates example requirements for stable
releases, ensuring deployed examples always use versions available
on PyPI. (c86bec5)

## [0.1.20-rc.1] - 2025-12-04


### Added

- Feat(release): add two-tier staging/production release system (#53)

* feat(release): add two-tier staging/production release system

Implement automatic staging releases and manual production releases:

- Staging: Automatic on push to main (PyPI prerelease, npm @next, staging-* Docker)
- Production: Manual workflow dispatch (PyPI, npm @latest, vX.Y.Z + latest Docker)

Changes:
- Add push trigger with path filters for automatic staging
- Replace release_channel with release_environment input
- Unified PyPI publishing for both staging (prerelease) and production
- Split npm publishing: @next tag (staging) vs @latest (production)
- Conditional Docker tagging: staging-X.Y.Z vs vX.Y.Z + latest
- Add install-staging.sh for testing prerelease binaries
- Update RELEASE.md with two-tier documentation

* refactor(install): consolidate staging into single install.sh with --staging flag

Instead of separate install.sh and install-staging.sh scripts:
- Single install.sh handles both production and staging
- Use --staging flag or STAGING=1 env var for prerelease installs
- Eliminates code drift between scripts

Usage:
  Production: curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash
  Staging:    curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --staging

### Other

- Update versions (a7912f5)

## [0.1.19] - 2025-12-04


### Fixed

- Fix(ui): add API key header to sidebar execution details fetch

The useNodeDetails hook was making a raw fetch() call without including
the X-API-Key header, causing 401 errors in staging where API key
authentication is enabled. Other API calls in the codebase use
fetchWrapper functions that properly inject the key. (f0ec542)

## [0.1.18] - 2025-12-03


### Fixed

- Fix(sdk): inject API key into all HTTP requests

The Python SDK was not including the X-API-Key header in HTTP requests
made through AgentFieldClient._async_request(), causing 401 errors when
the control plane has authentication enabled.

This fix injects the API key into request headers automatically when:
- The client has an api_key configured
- The header isn't already set (avoids overwriting explicit headers)

Fixes async status updates and memory operations (vector search, etc.)
that were failing with 401 Unauthorized.

## [0.1.17] - 2025-12-03


### Fixed

- Fix(control-plane): remove redundant WebSocket origin check

The WebSocket upgrader's CheckOrigin was rejecting server-to-server
connections (like from Python SDK agents) that don't have an Origin
header. This caused 403 errors when agents tried to connect to memory
events WebSocket endpoint with auth enabled.

The origin check was redundant because:
1. Auth middleware already validates API keys before this handler
2. If auth is enabled, only valid API key holders reach this point
3. If auth is disabled, all connections are allowed anyway

Removes the origin checking logic and simplifies NewMemoryEventsHandler
to just take the storage provider.

## [0.1.16] - 2025-12-03


### Fixed

- Fix(example): use IPv4 binding for documentation-chatbot

The documentation chatbot was binding to `::` (IPv6 all interfaces) which
causes Railway internal networking to fail with "connection refused" since
Railway routes traffic over IPv4.

Removed explicit host parameter to use the SDK default of `0.0.0.0` which
binds to IPv4 all interfaces.

The MemoryEventClient was not including the X-API-Key header when
connecting to the memory events WebSocket endpoint, causing 401 errors
when the control plane has authentication enabled.

Changes:
- Add optional api_key parameter to MemoryEventClient constructor
- Include X-API-Key header in WebSocket connect() method
- Include X-API-Key header in history() method (both httpx and requests)
- Pass api_key from Agent to MemoryEventClient in both instantiation sites

- Feat(sdk-python): expose execution context via app.ctx property

Add a `ctx` property to the Agent class that provides direct access to
the current execution context during reasoner/skill execution. This
enables a more ergonomic API:

Before:
  from agentfield.execution_context import get_current_context
  ctx = get_current_context()
  workflow_id = ctx.workflow_id

After:
  workflow_id = app.ctx.workflow_id

The property returns None when accessed outside of an active execution
(e.g., at module level or after a request completes), matching the
behavior of app.memory. This prevents accidental use of stale or
placeholder context data.

Also fixes integration test fixtures to support the current monorepo
structure where control-plane lives at repo root instead of
apps/platform/agentfield.

Updates the README's quick start section to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly guide.

This revision clarifies the installation process, introduces a dedicated step for agent creation with a default configuration option using `af init --defaults`, and specifies the necessary command-line instructions for each terminal in the control plane + agent node architecture.

It also refines the example API call to use a more descriptive agent endpoint (`my-agent.demo_echo`) and adds examples for Go and TypeScript, as well as detailing how to use interactive mode for agent initialization. (4e897f0)

- Improve LLM prompt formatting and citations

Refactors the system and user prompts for the documentation chatbot to improve clarity and LLM performance. This includes:

- Restructuring and clarifying the prompt instructions for citations, providing explicit guidance on how to use and format them.
- Enhancing the citation key map format to be more descriptive and user-friendly for the LLM.
- Explicitly stating that the `citations` array in the response should be left empty by the LLM, as it will be injected by the system.
- Updating the `Citation` schema to correctly reflect that the `key` should not include brackets.
- Adding a specific "REFINEMENT MODE" instruction to the refined prompt to guide the LLM's behavior in a second retrieval attempt.
- Minor cleanup and adjustments to prompt text for better readability. (56246ad)

- Update dependencies for improved compatibility

Updates several npm package dependencies, including browserslist, caniuse-lite, and electron-to-chromium, to their latest versions.
This ensures better compatibility and incorporates recent improvements and bug fixes from these packages. (c72278c)

- Implement automatic agent method delegation

Improves the AgentRouter by implementing __getattr__ to automatically delegate any unknown attribute or method access to the attached agent. This eliminates the need for explicit delegation methods for agent functionalities like `ai()`, `call()`, `memory`, `note()`, and `discover()`.

This change simplifies the AgentRouter's interface and makes it more transparently proxy agent methods. Added tests to verify the automatic delegation for various agent methods and property access, as well as error handling when no agent is attached. (26c9288)

- Fix Python 3.8 CI: Disable coverage for Python 3.8

The PyO3 modules in pydantic-core can only be initialized once per
interpreter on Python 3.8. pytest-cov causes module reimports during
coverage collection, triggering this limitation.

Solution:
- Keep --import-mode=importlib for better import handling
- Disable coverage collection (--no-cov) only for Python 3.8 in CI
- Coverage still collected for Python 3.9-3.12

This is a known compatibility issue with PyO3 + Python 3.8 + pytest-cov.

- Fix Python 3.8 CI: Add --import-mode=importlib to pytest config

Resolves PyO3 ImportError on Python 3.8 by configuring pytest to use
importlib import mode. This prevents PyO3 modules (pydantic-core) from
being initialized multiple times, which causes failures on Python 3.8.
